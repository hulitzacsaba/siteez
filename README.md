# SiteEz
A website that can make other websites from Markdown language files.
### Premise
It requires no knowledge of Markdown or any programming languages, it just seems like a basic text editor for anyone. Of course for a person who can write Markdown, it's just a glorified converter. It will be converted to HTML.
### Language
I thought it would be written in ReactJS and of course Markdown for the text editor part. It's early in development
and I don't really know right now.
### Goal
The goal is to make it usable and simple. Nothing serious. Maybe if I'm done with it, I will add more features, for now I want to do the basic syntax, the converting, etc.
### Build
To initalize the project, clone it to a folder. Then run `npm install` in the client and the server folder too. This will download all the modules for both side.
### Start
To start the client side, navigate to the client folder and run `npm start` in a console. This will start the dev server for the React app. To start the server side, you need to run the node command, `node index.js` in the server folder, this will start the node server.
### Access
To see the app, type and go to `localhost:3000` in a browser's url field. The port can change but that will be displayed in the console on start-up.

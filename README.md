# SiteEz
A website that can make other websites from Markdown language files.
### Premise
It requires no knowledge of Markdown or any programming languages, it just seems like a basic text editor for anyone. Of course for a person who can write Markdown, it's just a glorified converter. It will be converted to HTML.
### Language
I thought it would be written in ReactJS and of course Markdown for the text editor part. It's early in development
and I don't really know right now.
### Goal
The goal is to make it usable and simple. Nothing serious. Maybe if I'm done with it, I will add more features, for now I want to do the basic syntax, the converting, etc.

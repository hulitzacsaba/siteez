          <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
          <br />
          <h3>What are Frequently Asked Questions?</h3>
          <p>
            Frequently asked questions are questions which are asked by the user
            for a certain reason, like how to use something on the website or
            how to do something on the site. These answer are here to help.
          </p>
          <h3>How do you use the site?</h3>
          <p>
            To use the site, use a bit of your mind. Get creative, when you got
            ideas, write the text in the fields.
          </p>
          <h3>What does noscript and other things mean?</h3>
          <p>The following fields do that following things:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Website title: is the text which appears on the little tab in your
              browser on the top bar. It's usually short and snappy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Noscipt title: is the text which appears on your website if the
              user doesn't have Javascript turned on. This happens only in rare
              cases though, but its good to be sure.
            </li>
            <li>
              Website language: is pretty understandable, it's the language the
              site is in coded/used. It's how it appears in the browser and how
              it's displyed in the search results.
            </li>
            <li>
              Website character set: is a value which is the site coded in
              text-wise. UTF-8 is pretty standard but there are other options
              here too,
            </li>
            <li>
              Body text editor: is the field where you can edit and make the
              website's body. More on this a bit down.
            </li>
            <h3>How the heck does the body text editor works?</h3>
            <p>
              Glad you asked! The body text editor has to sides by default. A
              text editor left side and the pure MD output on the right. To make
              the site you need to use the left side. You can use the buttons
              for quick formatting and other options. Other than that, you can
              write anything here and it will be displayed on the right, that's
              how it will look. Only with the default html text-font stlye.
              That's how it can make the site. You can put pictures and links
              too with the buttons.
            </p>
            <h3>What do I do if the fields are full and I am ready?</h3>
            <p>
              Press the button down there, and the site will do it's best to
              match your text edit. The file will be avaliable to download as
              soon as it's ready.
            </p>
            <h3>How does the profile system work?</h3>
            <p>
              You can create a profile on the site and log in anytime. The
              benefit to registering is site saving. When you press the button
              and you are logged in, then you automatically upload the site to
              Pastebin. You can check your saved sites in your Profile tab, and
              see the Pastebin links too.
            </p>
            <h3>Are there any easter eggs?</h3>
            <p>Sadly no. :( </p>
            <h3>What if I encounter an error?</h3>
            <p>
              Pray to god it doesn't happen again, and send me an error report
              with what you did and what happened on GitHub.
            </p>
            <h3>Will this be expnaded?</h3>
            <p>Maybe, up to how much time I have.</p>
            <h3>
              Why should I use this, when there are better sites like Wix?
            </h3>
            <p>
              This just meant to be a little project to make a fun site everyone
              can easily use. It's not a competitor to other site making
              websites. It's not even close to be honest.
